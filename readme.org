* Nyxt .deb archive

The [[.github/workflows/release.yaml]] file was used by
https://github.com/atlas-engineer/nyxt to produce a =.deb= archive.

A particularity of this archive is that it features a =nyxt= binary that embeds
some required static libraries (like [[https://github.com/sionescu/libfixposix][libfixposix]]) that may not be present on the
target system.
